# Outline of week 14

I am teaching my students debugging and exception handling this week.

I am making 2 different learning material:

- Lecture slides: These cover the concepts mainly so they have more discussion and definitions but less code (students do not run code in class).

- Worksheets: These are more code-heavy. So we mainly provide code snippets that students should run and learn from by experimenting (little to no explanation).
